# Technologies 
#### React 
#### TypeScript 
#### Vite
#### Material UI

# Reasons For Using the listed Technologies

#### In the frontend development, I chose Vite as the build tool due to its fast development environment and excellent support for modern JavaScript and TypeScript. React was selected as the UI library, #### providing a component-based architecture for building interactive and reusable user interfaces. To enhance type safety and code quality, I integrated TypeScript with React. For a consistent and visually appealing design, I incorporated Material-UI (Mui) components, leveraging its rich set of pre-designed elements.
